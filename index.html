            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Emilee Bogdan. I am currently in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp with the hopes of becoming a Full Stack developer. I currently am a Business Operations Coordinator in Healthcare with a background in project management. I have a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from Weber State University and graduated in 2020. I am making a huge career change into the tech industry and I could not be more excited.
                I am from Salt Lake City, Utah and have lived here for most of my life. I spent about three years in Henderson, Nevada and still have not recovered from the heat. I am a huge dog lover and have a German Shepard Husky Mix named Charlie. In my spare time, I am a Power Lifter and I am in preparation for my first competition in October 2022. (Wish me luck!)
